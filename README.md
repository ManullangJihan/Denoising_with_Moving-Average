# Moving-Average

Moving-Average is a calculation used to analyze data points by creating a series of averages of different subsets of the full data set. This study aim to understand the usefullness of MA in Sounds signal. Understanding the impacts of random, short-term fluctuations on the signal over a specified time. 

The Algorithm that used in this study can be divide into 

1. Explore the datasets
2. Normalize the data using zero means
3. Build the Moving Average (MA) for Right MA, Left MA, and Symmetry MA
4. Slide the MA with the determined window (in this study we used 5,10,15)
7. Calculate MSE and RMSE
8. Visualize the data before and after denoising
